# HawkesNest

HawkesNest is a lightweight sandbox for experimenting with spatio‑temporal event data generated by Hawkes processes.  It exposes modular building blocks for backgrounds, kernels and interaction graphs together with utilities to measure the resulting model complexity.

## Features

- **Background models** – constant rates, spatial mixtures and entangled spatio‑temporal fields in `hawkesnest.background`.
- **Triggering kernels** – separable exponential–Gaussian kernels, mixtures and network versions in `hawkesnest.kernel`.
- **Interaction graphs** – utilities to build and analyse branching matrices in `hawkesnest.graph`.
- **Complexity metrics** – entanglement, heterogeneity, kernel roughness, graph complexity and topology metrics under `hawkesnest.metrics`.
- **Simulator** – an Ogata thinning based generator found in `hawkesnest.simulator`.
- **Command‑line interface** – `hawkesnest simulate` to create event data from the shell.

## Installation

The project requires Python 3.8 or later.  Install dependencies and the package with

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or
pip install -e .
```

This will provide the `hawkesnest` command line tool.

## Usage

Generate a small dataset with the default configuration:

```bash
hawkesnest simulate --n-events 10 --seed 42
```

The events are stored as a Parquet file.  Run `hawkesnest simulate --help` for a list of available options.

## Testing

Run the unit tests with

```bash
pytest -q
```

This repository is intentionally simple and serves as a base for exploring spatio‑temporal Hawkes process models and their complexity measures.
